# Pridiction-and-classification-of-cardiac-arrythmia

->Prediction and Classification of cardiac arrhythmias by using MACHINE LEARNING in which using different algorithms of machine learning like SVM, NAIVE BAYES, logistics regression and KNN, we tried to classify the different levels of cardiac arrhythmias.so that easily diagnosis is possible.

->download arrythmia dataset from the UCI repository.

->download the anaconda and run in spyder.
